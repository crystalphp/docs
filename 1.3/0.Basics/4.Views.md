# Views
As you know, when we define paths, we return a string as the output. This is probably not the answer. We want to return html pages which is unreasonable if we want to do it in a string format. This is where we need views. views are graphical interface files that are returned to the user instead of strings. The views in crystal are in the `cv`.

# Working With Views
The views in the crystal are in the `resources/views` folder.
Let's create a file called `test.cv.php` inside this folder. And write a Hello world code inside it.
Let's define a path inside `routes.php`:

```php
<?php

$router->get('/hello' , function(){
    return view('test');
});
```

Now anyone going to the `/hello` path on the site, instead of receiving a string, will get the contents of the file `resources/views/test.cv.php`.


So what if we want a view in another folder that is inside the view folder? For example, our view is here:

`resources/views/user/index.cv.php`

Then how do we name the desired view?
You can then use `/` in the view name:

```php
<?php

$router->get('/someplace' , function(){
    return view('user/index'); // don't need to write that .cv.php in here
});

$router->get('/foo' , function(){
    return view('dir/subdir/somedir/viewname'); // pointer to resources/view/dir/subdir/somedir/viewname.cv.php
});
```

You can also use `.` instead of `/` to get more beautiful code:

```php
<?php

$router->get('/someplace' , function(){
    return view('user.index'); // pointer to resources/view/user/index.cv.php
});

$router->get('/foo' , function(){
    return view('dir.subdir.somedir.viewname'); // pointer to resources/view/dir/subdir/somedir/viewname.cv.php
});
```
