# Middlewares
Middlewares are the things that check a set of conditions before any request to our site should receive a response. That is, a http request must pass the middleware filter before it can receive a response.
For example, we have an admin panel located in `/admin`. We now want to set a condition for any user to access this page before checking that it is an administrator and then accessing this section.

# Working With Middlewares
All middleware in Crystal is in the middlewares folder. If you look at this folder, you will find that it has 3 middleware by default, one of which is DefaultMiddleware. The contents of a middleware are as follows:

```php
<?php

namespace Middlewares;

use Crystal\Middlewares\Middleware;
use Crystal\Http\Request;

class DefaultMiddleware extends Middleware
{
	public function handle(Request $r){

		// write your codes and conditions check here...

		return false; // don't delete this line
	}
}
```

As you can see, middleware is defined as a class and inside them there is a function called handle that receives a Request object (you already know the Request). Now let's go back to the file `routes.php`:

```php
<?php

$router->get('/someplace' , 'HomeController@index' , ['DefaultMiddleware']);
$router->get('/someplace' , 'HomeController@index' , 'DefaultMiddleware');
```

The Router functions also receive a third input, which is optional, and that is the third input the middleware you want to run before the user accesses this path. As you can see, here we have two passwords called `DefaultMiddleware`. We may want to examine some middleware, then pass it on to the array. And if we only consider middleware, we can pass it in the form of a regular string


Now the middleware that we set for the paths is executed in the `handle` function, the output of this function is` false`, the program goes to the next steps, such as the next middleware check or the desired action path. But if the output of this function is anything other than `false`, the program will stop and show this output to the user.


Let's look at the same admin panel example:

#### DefaultMiddleware.php:
```php
<?php

namespace Middlewares;

use Crystal\Middlewares\Middleware;
use Crystal\Http\Request;

class DefaultMiddleware extends Middleware
{
	public function handle(Request $r){

		// checking the user can access to the admin panel
		if(user_is_admin()){ // !!! user_is_admin function is Hypothetical !!!
		    return false; // going to the next steps
		}else{
		    //return 'just admins can access here. you don\'t have permission to access here;
		    // or
		    return redirect('/someplace'); // redirecting the user to the /someplace
		}
		

		return false; // don't delete this line
	}
}
```



#### routes.php:
```php
<?php

$router->any('/admin' , 'AdminController@index' , 'DefaultMiddleware');
$router->any('/admin/users' , 'AdminController@users' , 'DefaultMiddleware');
$router->any('/admin/settings' , 'AdminController@settings' , 'DefaultMiddleware');
```



## call_list function
The `middleware` class has a function called` call_list` that takes the array from the middleware list and executes them in sequence. For example you want to run one or more middleware from within a middleware, this is where this function will help you. for example:

```php
<?php

namespace Middlewares;

use Crystal\Middlewares\Middleware;
use Crystal\Http\Request;

class DefaultMiddleware extends Middleware
{
	public function handle(Request $r){

		$this->call_list(['TestMiddleware' , 'SomeMiddleware']); // calling other middlewares from this middleware
		

		return false; // don't delete this line
	}
}
```
