# Middlewares
Middlewares are the things that check a set of conditions before any request to our site should receive a response. That is, a http request must pass the middleware filter before it can receive a response.

# Working With Middlewares
All middleware in Crystal is in the middlewares folder. If you look at this folder, you will find that it has 3 middleware by default, one of which is DefaultMiddleware. The contents of a middleware are as follows:

```php
<?php

namespace Middlewares;

use Crystal\Middlewares\Middleware;
use Crystal\Http\Request;

class DefaultMiddleware extends Middleware
{
	public function handle(Request $r){

		// write your codes and conditions check here...

		return false; // don't delete this line
	}
}
```
