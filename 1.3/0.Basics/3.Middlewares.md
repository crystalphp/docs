# Middlewares
Middlewares are the things that check a set of conditions before any request to our site should receive a response. That is, a http request must pass the middleware filter before it can receive a response.
For example, we have an admin panel located in `/ admin`. We now want to set a condition for any user to access this page before checking that it is an administrator and then accessing this section.
