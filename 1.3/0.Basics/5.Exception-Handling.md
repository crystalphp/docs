# Exception Handling
Errors may occur in any application. Crystal lets you easily manage errors.
In crystal projects, the `app/ExceptionHandler.php` file is responsible for error handling. The contents of this file are as follows:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Crystal\Exceptions\BaseException;

class ExceptionHandler{
	public function report(BaseException $ex){
		return $ex->report();
	}

	public function handle(BaseException $ex){
		return $ex->render();
	}
}
```



There are two functions in this class. Let's first get to the `render` function. But first of all, let's create an error in our program. For example, do this in the `routes.php` file:


```php
<?php

gffhjhjghjyfg // the syntax error

$router->any('/' , function(){
    return view('hello');
});
```
