# Controllers
As you know, the `app/routes.php` file is an important file that contains almost all of the things we do on different pages of our site. But if we have a huge project that has a lot of pages and a lot of work on each of those pages, then we find that the `app/routes.php` file is very busy.
In fact, the controllers are here to help us. Controllers are things that allow us to do everything in a single path, move them, and just call them in the `app/routes.php` file, and so the main code of our program in the file routes.php does not shrink and gets more organized.
