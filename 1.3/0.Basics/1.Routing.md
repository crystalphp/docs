# Routing
In design and development of the Web, one of the most important tasks to be done is routing. In plain language, the routing is based on what the user has been doing and what to show him.

For example, let us say if the user went to the screen or the same path /login output, we would show him the login screen.

In crystal, as well as all other framework, we have the path to which the main file is the app / routes.php file we are going to get to see later.
