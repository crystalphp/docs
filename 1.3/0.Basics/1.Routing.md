# Routing
In design and development of the Web, one of the most important tasks to be done is routing. In plain language, the routing is based on what the user has been doing and what to show him.

For example, let us say if the user went to the screen or the same path /login output, we would show him the login screen.

In crystal, as well as all other framework, we have the path to which the main file is the app/routes.php file we are going to get to see later.

# Working with Router
let 's start with the app/routes.php file . formally , the contents of this file are as follows :

```php
<?php

$router->any('/' , function(){
    return view('hello');
});
```

as can be seen , there is an object called a $router , which we define .

and here is a function of any at $router , and in the first entry we are given it , and at the second entrance is a closure .

here 's what every request means . http protocol has different methods such as get and post .

when there is any any kind of request for this route , let 's call the get or post instead :

```php
<?php

$router->get('/hereisget' , function(){
    return 'hello get';
});

$router->post('/hereispost' , function(){
    return 'hello post';
});
```

as we have said , the second entrance to the router is the closure of the closure . it follows that if the user enters the path we defined , it runs the closure and then shows its output to the user . consider the following example :

```php
<?php

$router->get('/login' , function(){
    return 'this is a login page';
});

$router->post('/login' , function(){
    return 'this is a post action for login page';
});

$router->get('/profile' , function(){
    return 'it\'s user profile';
});
```

# Actions Parameters


You will be able to define inputs to all entries.
The first input you define for closure is Request, which is a type of class Crystal\Http\Request, which you can access to the request data by using this object:

```php
<?php

use Crystal\Http\Request;

$router->get('/login' , function(){
    return 'The Login Form';
});

// then login form has submit
$router->post('/login' , function(Request $r){
    $username = $r->post('username');
    $password = $r->post('password');
    // do login
});

```



different things can be done with an Request object:


```php
// ...
$router->any('/someplace' , function(Request $r){
    $r->post('key'); // access the post data with key.
    $r->get('key'); // access the get data with key.
    $r->ip(); // ip of remote host
    $r->remoteAddr; // ip of remote host
    $r->serverProtocol; // get the server protocol
    $r->httpHost; // get the http host as string
    // and some thing else ...
})
```




You may want to use the request helper function more easily. It is not necessary to define an input request to access the request data. By using this function, you can have access to the same object:

```php
// ...
$router->any('/someplace' , function(){
    request()->post('key'); // access the post data with key.
    request()->get('key'); // access the get data with key.
    request()->ip(); // ip of remote host
    request()->remoteAddr; // ip of remote host
    request()->serverProtocol; // get the server protocol
    request()->httpHost; // get the http host as string
    // and some thing else ...
})
```



# Parameter routes


Often in some paths, a part of the path is variable. For example, we have a single page showing the profile of a user of properties and its path is shaped like this:

`/profile/<username of user>`

as much as possible.

We know that instead of <, the user of the user becomes a variable strand. We may want to see `/profile/parsampsh` , `/profile/jack` once. It must not be the right thing to make a path for every user we have in our universe. This is where we need parameter paths. In this type of paths one can vary from one to several parts of the path. To define the parameter paths, we do this:

```php
<?php

$router->get('/profile/{username}' , function(){
    return 'profile';
});

```



As you can see, we have put something like, `{username}`, rather than a changing environment. Now, if we go to  `/profile/parsampsh` and what to go to `/profile/jack` , we see on the word "profile" page. Now, how do we get access to the imported value instead of username?

Here, you need to define a second entry:

```php
<?php

$router->get('/profile/{username}' , function(Request $r , $params){
    return 'profile of ' . $params['username'];
});

```




here are some examples :


```php
<?php

$router->get('/articles/{id}' , function($r , $params){
    return 'we are reading an article with id' . $params['id'];
});

```
