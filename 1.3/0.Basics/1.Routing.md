# Routing
In design and development of the Web, one of the most important tasks to be done is routing. In plain language, the routing is based on what the user has been doing and what to show him.

For example, let us say if the user went to the screen or the same path /login output, we would show him the login screen.

In crystal, as well as all other framework, we have the path to which the main file is the app/routes.php file we are going to get to see later.

# Working with Router
let 's start with the app/routes.php file . formally , the contents of this file are as follows :

`<?php`

`$router->any('/' , function(){`

`    return view('hello');`

`});`

as can be seen , there is an object called a $router , which we define .

and here is a function of any at $router , and in the first entry we are given it , and at the second entrance is a closure .
